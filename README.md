## **📖 About the Project**

This chatbot aims to bridge the gap between complex medical information and the general public. By using a powerful language model, it can understand and respond to a wide range of health-related questions in a natural and intuitive way.

**(You** can **expand this section to describe the problem you are solving in more detail, for example: "The goal is to provide users with a reliable and accessible first point of contact for medical inquiries, helping them understand symptoms, find information about conditions, and learn about preventive care.")**

## **✨ Features**

* **Conversational AI:** Utilizes a Large Language Model for natural and fluid conversations.  
* **Medical Knowledge Base:** Trained or fine-tuned on a corpus of medical data to provide relevant information.  
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to interact with through a command-line interface or a simple web UI (if planned).  
* **Extensible:** Built with a modular structure, making it easy to add new features or integrate different models.  
* **Contextual Understanding:** Remembers previous parts of the conversation to provide more relevant answers.  
* **(Add any other specific features your chatbot has or will have)**

## **💻 Tech Stack**

This project is built using the following technologies:

* **Python 3.10**  
* **Conda:** For environment management  
* **Git:** For version control  
* **(Add** other key libraries **here, e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Flask, Streamlit, FastAPI, NLTK, spaCy etc.)**  
* **(Mention any specific LLM used, e.g., GPT-3, Llama, Gemini, etc.)**

## **🚀 Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Git:** [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
* **Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda):** [Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)  
  * *Verify Conda installation by typing conda \--version in your terminal.*

### **Installation & Setup**

1. Clone the Repository  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project repository from GitHub:  
   git clone \[https://github.com/KillerBee062/MedicalChatBotGenAI.git\](https://github.com/KillerBee062/MedicalChatBotGenAI.git)

   Navigate into the cloned directory:  
   cd MedicalChatBotGenAI

2. Create and Activate the Conda Environment  
   The following command will create a new Conda environment named medichat with Python 3.10. The \-y flag automatically confirms all prompts.  
   conda create -n medichat python=3.10 -y

   Activate the newly created environment:  
   conda activate medichat

   *(Your terminal prompt should now indicate that the medichat environment is active.)*  
3. Install Required Libraries  
   With the medichat environment active, install all the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

   *(Note:* If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, you should create one. *After manually installing your project's dependencies (e.g., pip install somepackage), you can generate it by running: pip freeze \> requirements.txt)*  
4. Environment Variables (If Applicable)  
   Many projects, especially those involving APIs or sensitive configurations, use environment variables. If your project requires them:  
   * Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project.  
   * Add your configuration details in KEY=VALUE format. For example:  
     \# .env file  
     OPENAI\_API\_KEY="YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE"  
     DATABASE\_URL="YOUR\_DATABASE\_CONNECTION\_STRING"

   * Ensure .env is listed in your .gitignore file to prevent committing sensitive information. You can provide a .env.example file as a template for other users.

## **▶️ Usage**

Once the setup is complete and all dependencies are installed, you can run the chatbot application.

**(Provide specific instructions on how to run your main application script. For example:)**

If your main script is app.py, you would typically run:

python app.py

Or, if it's a web application (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit):

flask run  
\# or  
streamlit run app.py

**(Include any command-line arguments or specific instructions for interaction.)**
